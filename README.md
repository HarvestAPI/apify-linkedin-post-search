## LinkedIn Posts Search scraper

Our powerful tool helps you search posts by text and filter by LinkedIn profiles or companies without compromising security or violating platform policies.

### Key Benefits

- No cookies or account required: Access profile data without sharing cookies or risking account restrictions
- Low pricing: $2 per 1k posts.
- Fast response times deliver data in seconds ðŸš€
- No caching, fresh data.
- Concurrency: each actor works scraping 3 search queries at a time.

## How It Works

- (required) List of search queries (e.g., `Hiring software engineer`, Hiring full stack developer`)
- (optionally) List of LinkedIn profile/company URLs who posted the content
- (optionally) List of LinkedIn public identifiers who posted the content (e.g., `williamhgates` from `https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates`)
- (optionally) List if LinkedIn profile/company IDs who posted the content (e.g. ACoAAA8BYqEBCGLg_vT_ca6mMEqkpp9nVffJ3hc)
- (optionally) List of LinkedIn companies where authors work (e.g., `Microsoft`, `Google`).

For example you can search posts by Google (or other company) employees who hire software engineers:

```json
{
  "searchQueries": [
    "Hiring software engineer",
    "Hiring full stack developer",
    "Hiring backend developer"
  ],
  "authorsCompanyPublicIdentifiers": ["google", "microsoft", "amazon", "meta"]
}
```

**This is Post Search scraper, so list of search queries is required. If you don't care about search queries, and you want to scrape all posts from specific companies or authors, our [LinkedIn Profile Posts Scraper](https://apify.com/harvestapi/linkedin-profile-posts) works better for this use-case**

Other params (optionally):

- `maxPosts` - Maximum number of posts to scrape per each search query. This overrides `scrapePages` pagination. If you set this to 0, it will scrape all posts.
- `scrapePages` - Number of pages to scrape, if `maxPosts` is not set. Each page is 20 posts.
- `page` - Page number to start scraping from. Default is 1.

### Data You'll Receive

- Post content
- Author information
- Social engagement metrics
- Media: images, videos, and links
- Content of Re-posts

Up to 1000 posts per one actor run.
